  PHP 7.3 yacc grammar
================================================================================

This is an adaption of PHP's 7.3 Yacc grammar for grmtools.

There are two major limitations to be aware of:

1) Some PHP strings can't be parsed with lrlex's purely regular expression
   based lexer. For example, PHP lexes strings containing variables, e.g.
   `"hello ${name}"`, as `T_STRING_VARNAME`. Due to limitations in the lexer,
   all strings will be lexed into `T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING`. Other
   unsupported strings are: T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE, T_NUM_STRING.

2) HEREDOC's and inlined HTML are currently not supported by the lexer at all.

Some minor differences to the original grammar are:

* Compiling this grammar results in 2 shift/reduce warnings. The reason for
  this is the dangling else problem, which is implicitly solved by grmtools.
  PHP resolves this problem by adding the non-existent `T_NOELSE` token, which
  takes precedence over `else`. Since this token can't exist, shifting `else`
  is chosen in favour of a reduction. However, grmtools requires all tokens to
  be defined in the lexer, and thus the `T_NOELSE` token needed to be removed. 

* There are a few token definitions that were removed from the grammar, since
  those tokens are either thrown away by the lexer, or were never used by the
  grammar. Those tokens are: T_COMMENT, T_OPEN_TAG, T_OPEN_TAG_WITH_ECHO,
  T_CLOSE_TAG, T_DOC_COMMENT.
